# MobileNetV2
Implementing deep learning architecture MobileNetv2 using Tensorflow on CIFAR10 dataset

Dataset

The CIFAR10 dataset is a classic dataset for the image classification task, which consists of 60000 32x32 RGB images in 10 classes.

Implementation

The original MobileNetV2 model is implemented on 224x224x3 images. I have slightly changed the model architecture to fit the image size of 32x32x3 in the CIFAR10 dataset.
